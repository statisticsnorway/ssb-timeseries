# Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the `ssb-timeseries` library's internal architecture and its core design principles.

## Core User Interfaces

A user primarily interacts with the library through two main entry points.
These are designed to separate the acts of *working with* data from *finding* data.

-   **The `Dataset` class**: This is the central point of interaction.
    It represents a single time series dataset, bringing together its data and metadata.
    It provides a rich API for I/O, calculations, and data manipulation.
-   **The `Catalog` module**: This provides functions for discovery and search within all datasets by name or metadata (tags) across all configured storage locations (repositories).
    The `get_catalog()` function acts as a simple facade, hiding the complexity of reading the configuration and instantiating the `Catalog` and `Repository` objects.

## Key Helper Modules

While `Dataset` and `Catalog` are the main interfaces, several helper modules provide the foundation for the library's flexibility and robustness.

-   **`properties`**: This module defines key enumerations `Versioning` and `Temporality` that constitutes the `SeriesType`.
    They form a type system core that allows key concepts from the {doc}`info-model` to translate into different technical implementations.
-   **`dates`**: This module provides utility functions for standardizing all time-related operations.
    It ensures consistent handling of timezones, frequencies, and formats throughout the library.
-   **`meta`**: This module manages structured metadata.
    Its primary purpose is maintaining simple key-value tags for sets and series, but it also provides an interface to taxonomies (like those from SSB's KLASS).
    It also provides the support logic for advanced, metadata-driven operations like hierarchical aggregation.
-   **`config`**: This module is the library's central nervous system.
    It loads all environment-specific settings from a JSON file, defining where data is stored and which backend handlers to use.
    This decouples the library's logic from hardcoded paths and storage implementations.
-   **`io`**: This module acts as the single gateway for all storage operations.
    As a strict **facade**, it ensures that all parts of the library read and write data through a consistent, high-level API.
    It operates using a plugin design controlled by configuration.

## Data Handling: The Interoperable Data Model

The library's approach to data handling is guided by a core conceptual model.
This model directly influences its choice of technologies and commitment to interoperability.

### The Concept: Datasets as Matrices

The library aims to provide easy and intuitive use of linear algebra for calculating derived data.
A key design feature is the interpretation of datasets as mathematical matrices of series vectors, all aligned by a common date axis.

To accomplish this, the basic data structure is a table where each time series is a column vector.
The `Dataset` object itself exposes a rich set of mathematical operations by overloading Python's standard operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
This allows for natural, expressive code, such as `new_dataset = (dataset_a + dataset_b) / 2`.

### The Implementation: An Opinionated, High-Performance Stack

This conceptual model naturally leads to an opinionated selection of high-performance, column-oriented technologies:

-   **[Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/)** is the standard for permanent storage.
    Its columnar format is highly efficient for the analytical queries typical in time series analysis.
-   **[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/)** is the preferred format for in-memory data.
    Its columnar layout and zero-copy read capabilities ensure high performance and seamless data sharing between processes.
-   **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)** serves as the powerful and reliable engine for all linear algebra calculations.
    When you perform a mathematical operation on a `Dataset`, the numeric data is typically converted to NumPy arrays to execute the computation.

### The Principle: Openness and Abstraction

While the core stack is opinionated, a primary goal is to avoid creating a "walled garden."
The library is designed to be a good citizen in the PyData ecosystem.

This is achieved through **[Narwhals](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/)**.
Narwhals is a lightweight abstraction layer that provides a unified API over multiple dataframe backends.
This strategic choice means the library's internal logic works seamlessly whether the in-memory data is a Pandas DataFrame, a Polars DataFrame, or a PyArrow Table, offering maximum flexibility and future-proofing.

### A Commitment to Interoperability

To guarantee that the `Dataset` object can be used by other libraries, it adheres to several standard protocols:

-   **The NumPy `__array__` Protocol**: A `Dataset` can be passed directly to most NumPy functions (e.g., `np.mean(my_dataset)`), as it knows how to convert itself into a NumPy array.
-   **The DataFrame Interchange Protocol (`__dataframe__`)**: This allows a `Dataset` to be converted into other dataframe types (like Pandas or Polars) with minimal overhead.
-   **The Arrow C Data Interface (`__arrow_c_stream__`)**: This enables efficient, zero-copy data sharing with other Arrow-native libraries and even other programming languages like R or Julia.
-   **Standard Python Operators**: By overloading operators like `__add__` and `__mul__`, the `Dataset` object can be used directly in mathematical expressions.
    The motive is to provide a natural and highly expressive syntax, allowing users to write code like `new_dataset = (dataset_a + dataset_b) / 2`.

## Metadata Handling: From Concept to Implementation

The library's approach to metadata is central to its design.
It begins with a conceptual model and is realized through a specific technical implementation.

### The Concept: Rich, Structured Descriptions

At its core, every `Dataset` and `Series` is described by a collection of attributes, or "tags".
Rather than being simple key-value pairs, these attributes are designed to take their values from well-defined taxonomies (such as those from SSB's KLASS).
This ensures that metadata is structured, consistent, and meaningful.

This conceptual model is detailed further in the {doc}`info-model`.

### The Implementation: A Dual Storage Approach

The technical implementation is designed to satisfy two core requirements: data portability and centralized discoverability.
This is achieved with a dual storage approach:

1.  **Embedded for Portability**: All descriptive tags are embedded directly into the header of the Parquet file.
    This ensures that the data and metadata are always connected, making each file a self-contained artifact that can be moved or shared without losing its context.
2.  **Indexed for Discoverability**: To fulfill the requirement for a central data catalog, the metadata is also duplicated into an indexed **JSON catalog**.
    This provides the crucial performance benefit of enabling fast, efficient searches across all datasets in a repository without needing to read the large data files themselves.

## The Decoupled I/O System

The library's ability to adapt to different storage environments is based on a decoupled I/O system.
This system follows a classic **Facade** and **Strategy** design pattern.

-   **The Facade (`ssb_timeseries.io`)**: As mentioned, this module is the single entry point for all storage operations.
    It presents a simple API (e.g., `read_data`, `save`, `search`) to the rest of the application.
-   **Pluggable Handlers (The Strategy)**: The facade reads the project's configuration to dynamically load the appropriate **I/O handler** for a given task.
    These handlers are the concrete "strategies" for different backends (e.g., local files, cloud buckets) and are defined in a single JSON file, as detailed in the {doc}`configure-io` guide.
    This design allows for specifying custom handlers from outside the core library.
-   **The Contract (`protocols.py`)**: The methods required for any I/O handler are formally defined in `protocols.py` using `typing.Protocol`.
    This ensures that any custom handler is compatible with the library's I/O system.

### The Three-Layer I/O Information Model

To ensure consistent behavior and coexistence between different I/O handlers, the system is designed around a three-layer information model.

1.  **The Logical Data Model (In-Memory `Dataset` Object)**: This represents a single, versioned "slice" of data with its full context. The `Dataset.data` dataframe contains only the core series data, and versioning information is stored as a metadata attribute on the `Dataset` object itself (e.g., `Dataset.as_of_utc`). This layer is clean, implementation-agnostic, and focused on a single version for efficient in-memory analysis.

2.  **The Physical Storage Model (I/O Handlers)**: This defines how a logical `Dataset` is persisted to a storage medium. Each I/O handler translates the logical model into a physical representation. For example:
    -   The `pyarrow_simple` handler embeds the `as_of_utc` metadata in the **filename**.
    -   The `pyarrow_hive` handler uses the `as_of_utc` metadata as a **Hive partition key**. For unversioned data, it uses a special partition named `as_of=__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__/`.

3.  **The Unified Query Model (External View)**: This is a conceptual model for how external query engines (e.g., DuckDB, Spark) should see the entire data repository, across all versions. It presents data as a single, unified table with an `as_of` column that is `NULL` for unversioned data. The `pyarrow_hive` handler is designed to create this model natively on disk, making the data immediately queryable in a unified way.
